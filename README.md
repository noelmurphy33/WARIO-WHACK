### Website Structure
I decided to keep the gameplay separate from the rest of the information on the site to keep the player undistracted from the gameplay so the site will have two pages. The main page will incorporate the intro, instructions, scoreboard, contact info and link to the game page. The gameplay page will contain the game itself and the relevant feedback to the player aswell as neccessary buttons to mute audio and exit back to the main page. 
###  Design Decisions
#### Colours
I used colors on the site to complement the mario and wario characters the color palette was generate by [coolers](https://coolors.co/).

#### Images
- The images for the home page and the gameplay are taken from [seekpng](https://www.seekpng.com/ks/clipart/) then changed using figma to suit the gameplay.
- The background image in the gameplay was taken from [Here](https://wallpaperaccess.com/cartoon-sky)

#### Typography
I decided to use [MODAK](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Modak) font for the site as i felt it created a gameing vibe on the site and matched the style of the gameplay.
